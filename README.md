Hey Guys,
Welcome to our Airbnb Clone. 
In this project we were able to develop an Airbnb Clone application with Python. 

# Command Line Interpreter
This a command line tool that would help us the developer to manage our project from the console. With this tool, we are able to create a database, update data in the database, remove objects from the database, exit the console and more....

# Usage
To Start it -----> run ./console.py this will open up the console, and grant you access to create, add, remove and update. To exit the command line interpreter  ----> type ./exit

To use, type help and you will find sample usage with detail instructions.
